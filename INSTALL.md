#### Activating theme
Essentially the theme is contained within the script itself so all you have to do is run the script.
It is recommended to bind the script in the configuration of your window manager or desktop environment.

1.  Go to the folder of the theme you just downloaded.
1.  Make the script executable (in case it isn't) with `chmod +x lock`.
2.  Launch the script with `./lock`.
